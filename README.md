# Push-up-counter-app

A simple Android app which is able to count your push-ups, gives you some execise suggestions and saves your progress.
It uses [posenet](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/posenet/android "Posenet"), a pre-trained deep learning model, to estimate body poses in real time.
The key points detected by posenet are used to count your push-ups.

Runs with Kotlin 1.5.21 and Gradle 4.2.1
